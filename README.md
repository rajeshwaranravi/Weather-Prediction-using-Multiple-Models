# Weather-Prediction-using-Multiple-Models
Different models used to predict the type of weather

Seattle Weather Dataset has been taken from kaggle (Link: - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ananthr1/weather-prediction)

Various predictive models were built and trained to predict possible future weather conditions and then models have been compared to identify the best one for the given dataset.

Models used for prediction:

Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Gradient Boosting Classifier

Logistic Regression

K Nearest Neighbors Classifier

Extreme Gradient Boosting Classifier

Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier

SVM Classifier

ANN Classifier
